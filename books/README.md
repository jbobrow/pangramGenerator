# Books for Pangram Generator

Place .txt files in this folder to create lexicons out of texts. Feel free to ask me about sources for .txt files of books, but this will also work with any text file you please. (i.e. I trained my first lexicon on a blog post of mine). If you want to train on a larger corpus, such as a bunch of books, the easiest way to do that right now is to place all texts into a single .txt file.

Note: This folder is purposefully empty so as not to share texts that are under copyright
